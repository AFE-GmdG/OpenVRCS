# OpenVRCS
C# Wrapper around the godot_openvr addon

## Hint:
This addon is only for internal use. You may use it too but I wont give you support nor will I accept pull requests.
It's based on the exceptional work of Bastiaan Olij [Godot OpenVR addon](https://github.com/GodotVR/godot_openvr) but instead on using GD Scripts it extends the GD Native Library parts with C# Classes and used it's own implementation of the XR Tools in C#.
